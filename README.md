## Instructions
**Creating a Config**

After you have created a new file or loaded an existing file. Click on the “Add New” button at the bottom to create a new config.

**Setting up a Config**

Once you select a configuration you should see something like:

**Name**

The name of the configuration will be used to identify the config. Each config name should be unique and different!
If using this with Quasi Sprite:
This value is used to identify the image as a Quasi Sprite by naming the file with the following format:
```
#configName-fileName
```
configName – the Name we set for the config.
* The # and – are important!

**Sample Image**

The sample image the application will use to show the slices and preview of poses.

**Columns**

The number of times to slice the image vertically.

**Rows**

The number of times to slice the image horizontally.

**AnchorX / Y**

The anchor position on for the sprite. Shown on the 1st sprite frame as a red cross:

**Poses**

The poses that are included inside this config.
* Click “Add New” to add another pose to the config.

**Indexes**

If you have a Sample Image loaded and you set your columns and rows, you will see white numbers on the top left of each slice.

These numbers are the Index for that slice. These values will be used when setting the pattern for a pose.

**Setting up Poses**

Once you select a pose, you should see something like:

**Name**

The name of the pose.

**Speed**

The time between changing frames

**Adjust?**

Sets a value to true or false. Can be used to adjust the Speed value if you don’t want it to be constant.
If using this with Quasi Sprite:
Adjust? will adjust the Speed value by the characters move speed ( MV Default behavior )

**Pattern**

A list of indexes that the pose will play. Each index should be separated a comma. For a range you can also use Start-End, ex: 0-10, will be reformatted as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
