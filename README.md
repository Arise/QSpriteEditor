## QSprite Editor

## How to run
**With Electron**

1. Download or Clone the repo

3. Install the dependencies by using the cli

 `npm install`
 
4. Run the app with electron by using the cli

 `npm start`


**From Prebuild**

Download a [prebuilt](/#Prebuilt) then run the QSprite shortcut or .exe in the app folder

## Building

`build:w64` and `build:w32` will build for Windows 64bit and 32bit

( That's assuming you're in the package.json directory, if not cd to that directory )
